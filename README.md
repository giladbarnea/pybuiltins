# pythonlang
### Hey everyone,

I'm implementing all [Python 3 Built-In Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) in Javascript (at least ones that are applicable).

Development just started in June, so there's still not a lot to work with.


Tests are imported from [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/master/Lib/test) and [PyPy](https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/src/default/pypy/objspace/std/test/) source codes, and I'm trying to implement the functions as close to the CPython source as I can.

You're very welcome to join in and help, or just check out this lib again around August-September when it will be somewhat useful already.

PM me at giladbrn@gmail.com if you have any questions, ideas as to what behaviors you would like to see, etc.
